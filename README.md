# Scoreboard-sorter
A small program that asks for a player name as well as their score, and sorts the list by descending order


Still looking for ways to make it as understandable as possible, as it seems to me that the program isn't that ergonomic, concise nor efficiently coded.

Aiming to implement different types of sorting algorithms to this somewhat illustrative exercice
